// Context:

// Imagine our agency as a buzzing beehive, like StackOverflow on steroids. We have a crazy number of cases popping up every day, each with a juicy bounty attached (yes, cold, hard cash!). And guess what? We've got thousands of Kusto Detectives scattered across the globe, all itching to pick a case and earn their detective stripes. But here's the catch: only the first detective to crack the case gets the bounty and major street cred!
// So, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to dig into the vast archives of our system operation logs from the legendary year 2022. You're on a quest to unearth the absolute legend, the detective with the biggest impact on our businessâ€”the one who raked in the most moolah by claiming bounties like a boss!
// Feeling a bit rusty or want to level up your Kusto skills? No worries, my friend. We've got your back with the "Train Me" section. It's like a power-up that'll help you sharpen your Kusto-fu to tackle each case head-on. Oh, and if you stumble upon a mind-boggling case and need a little nudge, the "Hints" are there to save the day!
// Now, strap on your detective hat, embrace the thrill, and get ready to rock this investigation. The fate of the "Most Epic Detective of the Year" rests in your hands!
// Good luck, rookie, and remember to bring your sense of humor along for this wild ride!
// Lieutenant Laughter
